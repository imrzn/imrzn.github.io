Earlier this year we shared a [community spotlight](https://xata.io/blog/community-spotlight-xata-go-sdk) focused on a community contributed Go SDK, [xata-go](https://github.com/kerdokurs/xata-go). [Kerdo Kurs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerdokurs/), the developer behind this project, was a huge inspiration for us committing to an official Go SDK. Today, we're thrilled to announce the first release of our Xata Go SDK, and to open the doors to the growing Go community ðŸŽ‰
The `v0.0.1` release features our most popular endpoints, enabling functionalities like searching a branch, using the ask endpoint for follow-up questions, and creating a database, among others.
You can see the evolving endpoint coverage in the ticket [xata-go#1](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).

If you want to get started right away, head over to the Go SDK [documentation](/docs/sdk/go/overview) and browse the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go).

In our documentation, we've included examples showing how to use the Go SDK, similar to the existing guides we have for TypeScript, Python, cURL, and SQL.

## Anatomy the SDK

The Go SDK is structured in namespaced clients, for example the `RecordsClient`.
All endpoints that are listed in our [API reference](/docs/api-reference/db/db_branch_name/transaction), are modeled within this client.

The available clients are:

- `BranchClient`
- `DatabasesClient`
- `FilesClient`
- `RecordsClient`
- `SearchAndFilterClient`
- `TableClient`
- `UsersClient`
- `WorkspaceClient`

The code and corresponding test suites can be found in the [xata package](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/xata).

```go
xata.databases().createDatabase("new_db",
  {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "branchName": "main",
  }
)
```

## Whatâ€™s next?

The SDK is an alpha release, and not all [endpoints are covered](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1), we continue to increase the API coverage of the SDK and provide bugfixes.

We can't do it without you! If you want to contribute [code](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go), add an [example](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/examples) update the [docs](/docs/sdk/go/overview), or found a bug  please open a PR or issue and we will assist you. All contributions are welcome âœ…
