We thrilled to announce the first release of our Xata Go SDK, and to open the doors to the growing Go community to Xata with an official SDK.
The `v0.0.1` release will feature the most popular endpoints out of the box, to allow you to search a branch, use the ask endpoint with follow up questions, create a database, you name it.
You can see the evolving endpoint coverage in the ticket [xata-go#1](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).

If you want to get started right away, head over to the Go SDK [documentation](/docs/sdk/go/overview) and browse the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go).

We have added examples in our docs to demonstrate how to use the Go SDK, as we have in place for TypeScript, Python, curl and SQL.

## Anatomy the SDK

The Go SDK is structured in namespaced clients, for example the `RecordsClient`.
All endpoints that are listed in our [API reference](/docs/api-reference/db/db_branch_name/transaction), are modelled within this client.

The available clients are:

- `BranchClient`
- `DatabasesClient`
- `FilesClient`
- `RecordsClient`
- `SearchAndFilterClient`
- `TableClient`
- `UsersClient`
- `WorkspaceClient`

The code and corresponding test suites can be found in the [xata package](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/xata).

```go
xata.databases().createDatabase("new_db",
  {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "branchName": "main",
  }
)
```

## Whatâ€™s next?

The SDK is an alpha release, and not all [endpoints are covered](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1), we continue to increase the API coverage of the SDK and provide bugfixes.

If you want to contribute [code](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go), add an [example](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/examples) or you found a missing piece the [docs](/docs/sdk/go/overview), please open a PR or ticket and we will assist you with your open-source contribution.

We can't do it without you! If you think something is missing or you found a bug, open a ticket in the [xata-go](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go) repository. All contributions are welcome.
