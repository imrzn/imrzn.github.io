Earlier this year we shared a [community spotlight](https://xata.io/blog/community-spotlight-xata-go-sdk) focused on a community contributed Go SDK, [xata-go](https://github.com/kerdokurs/xata-go). [Kerdo Kurs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerdokurs/), the developer behind this project, was a huge inspiration for us committing to an official Go SDK. Today, we're thrilled to announce the first release of our Xata Go SDK, and to open the doors to the growing Go community ðŸŽ‰
The `v0.0.1` release features our most popular endpoints, enabling functionalities like searching a branch, using the ask endpoint for follow-up questions, and creating a database, among others.
You can see the evolving endpoint coverage in the ticket [xata-go#1](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1).

If you want to get started right away, head over to the Go SDK [documentation](/docs/sdk/go/overview) and browse the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go).

In our documentation, we've included examples showing how to use the Go SDK, similar to the existing guides we have for TypeScript, Python, cURL, and SQL.

## Anatomy the SDK

The Go SDK is structured in namespaced clients, for example the `RecordsClient`.
All endpoints that are listed in our [API reference](/docs/api-reference/db/db_branch_name/transaction), are modeled within this client.

The available clients are:

- `BranchClient`
- `DatabasesClient`
- `FilesClient`
- `RecordsClient`
- `SearchAndFilterClient`
- `TableClient`
- `UsersClient`
- `WorkspaceClient`

The code and corresponding test suites can be found in the [xata package](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/xata).

If you used our SDKs, you'll recognize patterns like the naming of the APIs but within a Go idomatic way. 
To illustrate the usage of the Go SDK, we curated a couple of example, please browse to [our docs](/docs/sdk/get) to see the full bandwidth of examples.

The following example shortly demonstrate, how to use the Ask endpoint. 
For demo purposes we assume that the table `IMDB` contains all movies listed from [imdb.com](https://www.imdb.com/) and we want to learn how many Ace Venture movies exist.
More complex queries and follow up questions examples can be found [here](/docs/sdk/ask).

```go
searchClient, _ := xata.NewSearchAndFilterClient()
result, _ := searchClient.Ask(context.TODO(), xata.AskRequest{
  TableName: "IMDB",
  Question:  "How many Ace Ventura movies are there?",
})
```

In this example, we have not normalized data in multiple tables in one branch and want to search across this whole branch.
We are looking for a the name _Philip_, but as there are multiple ways of writing Philip, like _Filip_ or _Phillip_ or _Philippe_ we need apply fuzziness to our search.

```go
searchClient, _ := xata.NewSearchAndFilterClient()
results, _ := cli.SearchBranch(context.TODO(), xata.SearchBranchRequest{
  Payload: xata.SearchBranchRequestPayload{
    Query:     "Philip",
    Fuzziness: xata.Int(2),
  },
})
```

The last example illustrates the use of the [transaction](/docs/sdk/transaction) endpoint. 
Transactions are a powerful way to do multiuple operations in one go.
For the sake of the example, we solely want to create multiple records that list NBA players on a team.

```go
recordsClient, _ := xata.NewRecordsClient()
result, _ := recordsClient.Transaction(context.TODO(), xata.TransactionRequest{
  Operations: []xata.TransactionOperation{
    xata.NewInsertTransaction(xata.TransactionInsertOp{
      Table: "Players",
      Record: map[string]any{
        "name": xata.String("Paul George"),
        "team": xata.String("la_clippers"),
        "position": xata.String("SF"),
        "active": xata.Bool(true),
      },
      Record: map[string]any{
        "name": xata.String("Russell Westbrook"),
        "team": xata.String("la_clippers"),
        "position": xata.String("PG"),
        "active": xata.Bool(true),
      },
      Record: map[string]any{
        "name": xata.String("Charles Barkley"),
        "team": xata.String("houston_rockets"),
        "position": xata.String("PF"),
        "active": xata.Bool(false),
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

## Whatâ€™s next?

The SDK is an alpha release, and not all [endpoints are covered](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/issues/1), we continue to increase the API coverage of the SDK and provide bugfixes.

We can't do it without you! If you want to contribute [code](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go), add an [example](https://github.com/xataio/xata-go/tree/main/examples) update the [docs](/docs/sdk/go/overview), or found a bug  please open a PR or issue and we will assist you. All contributions are welcome âœ…
