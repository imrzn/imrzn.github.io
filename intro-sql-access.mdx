We are excited to introduce direct SQL access to your database.

Internally, Xata relies on PostgreSQL for storing your data. We would
like you to enjoy the goodness of SQL apart from the existing Xata
API.  From now on we support running some SQL commands over HTTP.  The
allowed statements are `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` with
some limitations.

You can run your queries over HTTP using either one of our SDKs or
directly using the REST API. You can submit one SQL statement in a
request. Multiple statements are not yet supported.

## How does it work?

We run a PostgreSQL instance that stores your database. Xata authenticates
and authorizes your request. If you have access to the database branch,
we validate that your statement is correct and only contains SQL keywords
and functions that are allowed.

If your statement is correct, we run it in PostgreSQL and return the response
from PostgreSQL, including rows and errors.

You can find more details about the SQL access in the documentation.
