We are excited to announce that Xata now offers direct SQL access to your database.
database.

Internally, Xata relies on [PostgreSQL](/docs/concepts/how-it-works) for storing your data.
We want you to experience the benefits of SQL beyond the existing Xata API.
API.  From now on we support running some SQL commands over HTTP.  The
allowed statements are `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` with
some limitations.

So if there is something that is not covered by the Xata API, you can
You also have the flexibility to execute your queries using the conventional Xata approach – using either the SDK or our REST API. Each request can contain a single SQL statement; currently, support for multiple statements is not available.

API. You can submit one SQL statement in a request. Multiple
statements are not yet supported.

We run a PostgreSQL instance that stores your database. Xata
authenticates and authorizes your request. If you have access to the
database branch, we validate that your statement is correct and only
contains only allowed SQL keywords and functions.

If your statement is correct, we run it in PostgreSQL and return the response
from PostgreSQL, including rows and errors.

You can find more details about the SQL access in the documentation.

## Limitations

As you access your database directly using SQL, the Xata goodies will not
be accessible to you. For example the special `email` Xata type is not safe.
You can only add or edit special data types using the Xata API.
